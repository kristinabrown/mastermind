Install this mastermind Gem with:

$ gem install mastermind_kb

This is a variation of the classic game, Mastermind. When you start a game a random 4-character combination of (r)ed, (b)lue, (y)ellow, and (g)reen is generated. It's up to you to guess the sequence, the colors in the position. With each guess you will be told how many colors are correct and how many are in the correct.
