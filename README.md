<h3>How To Play</h3>
This is a variation of the classic game, Mastermind. When you start a game a random 4-character combination of (r)ed, (b)lue, (y)ellow, and (g)reen is generated (example: 'RRBG'). It's up to you to guess the sequence; the correct colors in the correct position. With each guess you will be told how many colors are correct and how many are in the correct position.
